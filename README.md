This repository contains two main folders: `frontend` and `backend`. Follow the instructions below to run the project locally.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed (for both frontend and backend)
- Any package manager like npm or yarn

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Backend Setup

- Navigate to the backend folder:
  ```bash
  cd backend

- Start the backend server:
  npm start
  
The backend server should now be running on http://localhost:3001 (or whichever port you have set).

### 2. Frontend Setup

- Navigate to the frontend folder:
  ```bash
  cd frontend 

- Start the frontend server:
  npm start

The frontend app should now be running on http://localhost:3000/.

Notes:
    Make sure the backend server is running before starting the frontend.
    The frontend will make API calls to the backend to fetch data.
